# Beta Status
The beta status indicator tells users that the product is still being worked on.

## Visual Example

![Beta status indicator](./images/beta-status-bc.png)

## Use This For:
* Indicating your service is still being worked on and things may change.

## Don't Use This when:
* Your service is live and is no longer being actively worked on.

## Rationale
* The beta text has no border so users don't confuse the status for a button
* The text is visually distinct from the service name

Discuss this design on the [Beta Status Github Issue](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues/78)

## Behaviour
1. Additional research is being done for users to interact or understand the meaning of Beta.

## Accessibility
This checkbox has been built according to [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) standards and all government services should strive to meet this level.  This component successfully includes the following accessibility features:

### Screen readers

### Colour Contrast
* Gold text colour maintains at least 7:1 ratio on header blue background

### Text Size
* Beta badge text is at least 18px

## Code
