# Designing for Different Browsers and Operating Systems
Not all browsers will render web pages in the same way. There are often visible differences in the ways that different browsers handle technologies like CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

Services don’t have to look perfect in every browser but users must be able to access and use all the information and features they need, regardless of which browser they use.

## Compatibility Testing
These browsers and operating systems and are based on usage statistics from gov.bc.ca. These statistics represents about 95% of users. You should test your service in these browsers and operating systems.

| Browser       | Current Usage |
|---------------|---------------|
| Chrome        | 39%           |
| Mobile Safari | 24%           |
| IE 11         | 8%            |
| Chrome Mobile | 7.5%          |
| Firefox       | 5.5%          |
| Safari 12     | 5.3%          |
| Edge          | 5%            |

| Operating System | Current Usage |
|------------------|---------------|
| Windows          | 44%           |
| iOS              | 24%           |
| Android          | 14%           |
| Mac OS           | 10%           |
| Mac OS X         | 6%            |


## Services For Government Users
There are many internal government users still using IE 7 and other legacy browsers or operating systems.

If your service is aimed at internal users rather than the general public you should look at your analytics data and check which browsers and operating systems your users are using.

## Design for your Audience
When designing your service, you should analyse your users’ choice of:
* operating systems
* browsers
* browser versions
* screen size/resolutions
* choice of mobile device

If evidence shows that your users have specific needs or extra support requirements, you should design for these needs.

## Adapt to Changing Behaviour
Decisions about compatibility can’t be something you specify at the start of your project and then forget about. Digital services need to reflect and adapt to the changing digital behaviour of their users.

Do this by researching your users and checking statistics on a regular basis.

New products and platforms might not appear in any data, but it makes sense for you to test against them if they’re likely to be popular.

You also have to work out when to stop supporting a product or system if its popularity is declining.
