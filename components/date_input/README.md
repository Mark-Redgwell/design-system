## Requirements
* This component must be used according the the standard outined in this document. Any feedback should be directed to the feedback forum.

## How to Use This
*	Use when users need to enter an easily memorable date

## Don't Use This For
*	Dates that cannot be easily remembered
*	When users have to schedule something in the future, a calendar dropdown may be better.

## Rationale
Using three separate text fields is the fastest way for users to enter dates. Dropdown options cause accessibility difficulties.

## Behaviour

* Do not auto advance to next input field. This causes difficulties for users relying on keyboard controls.
* When in focus input field should outline with blue.
* Fields should have error controls such as not accepting more values than required, rejecting false values, and rejecting outlier values.
