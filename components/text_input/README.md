# Text Input

Text inputs allow users to enter any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols of their choosing in a structured format.

## Required

## Last Updated: 2 days ago

## Visual
  This is where the visual goes

## How to Use This:
When users have to:
* Input an answer that cannot be easily predicted
* Paste in a response
*	Input text that is no longer than a single line



Tips:
*	The length of the text input should provide a hint to the user on how much text to write.
*	Text inputs must have visible labels aligned above the text input they refer to. They should be short, direct, and written in sentence case.
*	Allow copy and paste functionality
*	Only show error validation messages or stylings after a user has interacted with a particular field.
*	Avoid using placeholder text. This causes additional problems for those with cognitive or visual disabilities.

## Don't Use This for:
*	If a user needs to input multiple lines of text. Use a text area component instead
*	When users can only choose from a selected list of answers.

## Rationale

## Behaviour
1. When activated the text box has a blue outline.

## Accessibility
This checkbox has been built according to WCAG 2.0 AA standards and has been successfully tested for the following:
1.	Perceivable
*	Alternative text is provided for non-text content (WCAG 1.1.1)
*	Content can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure (WCAG 1.3)
*	Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information (WCAG 1.4.1)
*	Visual presentation of text and images has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (WCAG 1.4.3)
*	Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200% without loss of content or functionality (WCAG 1.4.4)

2.	Operable
*	All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface (WCAG 2.1.1)
*	A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages (WCAG 2.4.1)
*	Headings and Labels describe topic or purpose (WCAG 2.4.6)
*	Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible (WCAG  2.4.7)

3.	Understandable
*	The default human language of each web page can be programmatically determined (WCAG 3.1.1)
*	Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated (WCAG 3.2.3)

4.	Robust
*	For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined (WCAG 4.1.2)
