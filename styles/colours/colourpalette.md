## Rationale
Our brand colours, BCID Blue and BCID Gold, are from our symbol, the BC Mark. Golden Yellow symbolizes warmth, energy, balance, enthusiasm, vibrancy and vitality. It is also associated with optimism, prosperity, prestige, wisdom, intelligence and security. Dark Blue symbolizes depth, expertise, stability, credibility, knowledge and integrity. It is also associated with health, law, order, logic, and dependability.

## Accessibility
This navigation bar has been built according to WCAG 2.0 AA standards and has been successfully tested for the following:

### Colour Contrast
*	WCAG 2.0 AAA standards requires normal text (18.66px and under) to have at least 7:1 ratio and large text (18.66 and bolded or 24px) to have at least a 4.5:1 ratio. Non-text contrast ratio should be at least 3:1 for adjacent colours.
