## Rationale
Our brand colours, BCID Blue and BCID Gold, are from our symbol, the BC Mark. Golden Yellow symbolizes warmth, energy, balance, enthusiasm, vibrancy and vitality. It is also associated with optimism, prosperity, prestige, wisdom, intelligence and security. Dark Blue symbolizes depth, expertise, stability, credibility, knowledge and integrity. It is also associated with health, law, order, logic, and dependability. 

## Accessibility
