### Screenreaders
* Proper ALT labels are included
* Language tag has been set to english
* [Proper semantic structure](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/) should be implemented

### Colour Contrast
* Contrast ratios are at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text

### Keyboard Navigation
* Supports tab navigation for use without a mouse
